Hi, I'm Gary Rafferty. I am a software developer based in Dublin.

I work for [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/) as a Development Team Lead. Our team are responsible
for the development and operations of the authoring and editing platform that
powers the core content of our guidebooks and website content. 
If you use our books, the content that you read has passed through our platform.
Our writers take the offline-friendly web application on the road into the deserts and jungles.
Our editors and curators use it to manage the content and to curate it into book chapters and API content.
We support all of this by maintaining and operating a stable and mature infrastructure stack.

Previously, I was cofounder and CTO of PropelAd, an E-commerce technology
company. PropelAd used web & email first party data to power lifecycle remarketing campaigns
for brands and online retailers. Our customers could target browsers who abandoned carts, engaged visitors, 
unengaged visitors, specific product viewers or nurture their existing customers with ease. We were one of the first Irish companies
to become a Facebook PMD (preferred marketing developer) for Insights and Analytics.
