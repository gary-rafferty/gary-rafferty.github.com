Hi, I'm Gary Rafferty, an engineering manager based in Dublin, Ireland.

I work at [Zalando](https://www.zalando.ie), where I lead an engineering team within our Merchant
Operations unit. Zalando is in the process of transforming from a traditional e-retailer to an ecommerce platform, and our team
is helping to provide the technological foundation to drive this change.

I previously worked at [Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/) leading a cross-functional engineering team who were responsible
for the development and operations of the authoring and editing platform that
powers the core content for guidebooks and digital.
If you read Lonely Planet guidebooks, then the content that you read has passed through our platform.

Previously, I was cofounder and CTO of
[PropelAd](https://angel.co/company/propelad), an ecommerce technology
company. PropelAd used web & email first party data to power lifecycle remarketing campaigns
for brands and online retailers. Our customers could target browsers who abandoned carts, engaged visitors, 
unengaged visitors, specific product viewers or nurture their existing customers with ease. We were one of the first Irish companies
to become a Facebook PMD (preferred marketing developer) for Insights and Analytics.
