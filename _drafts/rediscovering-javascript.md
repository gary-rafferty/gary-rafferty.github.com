I am currently reading [Rediscovering JavaScript](https://pragprog.com/book/ves6/rediscovering-javascript<Paste>).

For me, when I want to deepen my understanding of a language or framework, my
goto is usually a book on the topic. Right away, I'll usually open up VIm and
start playing around with code, which is fun and feels rewarding, but there's something about
reading that helps me to understand the inner workings and make sense of things
faster. For that reason, I'm a long time advocate of The Rails Way, by Obie Fernandez.

Over the years I've wrote a lot of Javascript, and felt that I had a pretty decent
grasp of the language. That was until I picked up a copy of [Javascript, The
Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do) by Douglas Crockford and quickly realised that my understanding
of the language was just at the tip of the iceberg. That book is full of little nougats of wisdom.

Similarly with ES6, I've been soaking up bit and pieces from blog posts,
documentation, and day to day development, but I wanted a good book to
deep-dive.

I am a long time fan of Pragmatic Bookshelf, and Rediscovering JavaScript by
Venkat Subramaniam was receiving good reviews online. He writes well and in
typical Pragmatic fashion, everything is cemented with a piece of code and some
exercises at the close of the chapter.

The first section of the book points out may JS gotchas, but provides safe new alternatives that will steer you in the right direction.
