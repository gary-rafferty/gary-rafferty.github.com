title: From scraps and notes to Jekyll

I'm not usually one for writing, but over the last few months I find myself scribbling down lots of notes,  
usually just for documenting steps to do a particular task.  

The problem is that I usually write them, then lose them and end up hitting Google or Stackoverflow.  
Anyway, I figure sticking them in the one place is a step in the right direction.
