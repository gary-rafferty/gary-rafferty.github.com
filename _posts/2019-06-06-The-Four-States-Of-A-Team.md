Identified by Will Larson in [An Elegant Puzzle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1732265186), a team can be viewed as residing within one of four states.

* Falling behind
* Threading water
* Paying down technical debt
* Innovating

Successful teams should transition from each state to the next. To do so, there
are a number of solutions that the system can provide.

A very, very brief overview follows. Read the book for more details, these are
just personal notes.

| State | Characteristics | System Solution |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
|Falling behind |Increasing backlog, low morale and dissatisfied users.|Add people, and set user expectations. Inject optimism.|
|Threading Water |Critical work is getting completed, but no room to paydown tech debt.|Reduce WIP and provide space to improve team productivity.|
|Paying down technical debt |Reaping the benefits of repayments and thinking towards innovation.|Add time to continue repayments whilst still supporting users.|
|Innovating |Low technical debt, high morale and satisfied users.|Add slack to the schedule to maintain state.|

Climbing from one stage to another takes time, but it's important to take a look
at your team, to identify your current state, and to define an appropriate
roadmap that helps you move towards the next state.
