Some notes and observations from [Atomic
Habits](https://www.bookdepository.com/Atomic-Habits-James-Clear/9781847941831), by James Clear.

I recently read Atomic Habits as recommended by [The Startup Book Club](https://thestartupbook.club/) reading list
for 2019. The goal of the book is to provide the reader with a framework for
making small improvements every day. If you can improve by 1% every day over the
course of a year, then at year end, you will be 37x better than you were.  

_"Small changes will compound into remarkable results over an extended period of time"_.

### How to build better habits

Habits can be broken down into a four step feedback loop.  
`cue -> craving -> response -> reward`.

We can use the `four laws of behaviour change` to build better habits.

1. Make it obvious.
2. Make it attractive.
3. Make it easy.
4. Make it satisfying.

#### Make it obvious

Often, the environment is more important than the motivation.
Every habit is initiated by a cue. In order to make those cues stand out, we
need to shape our environment. This can be as simple as leaving a book in every
room if you would like to become a reader. Reshaping your environment will also
help to fight against old or bad cues.

Another mechanism of making the cue obvious is to implement a technique known as
`Habit-stacking`. Habit stacking gets you to identify some existing habit and
pair some new behaviour with it. 
The formula for habit stacking is simply  
`After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].`

e.g After I make my morning coffee, I will meditate for one minute.

#### Make it attractive

The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become
habit-forming. `Dopamine++ = Motivation++`.

An interesting mechanism of making a new habit more attractive is to employ the
mechanism of `Temptation-bundling`. The purpose of this is to pair a habit that
you want, with a habit that you need.

```
After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]
After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT]
```
After I open my phone, I will read a page of a book.
After I read a page of a book, I will check Facebook.

The first is the need, the second is the want. You will eventually look forward
to the need because it leads to the want.

#### Make it easy

Human effort follows `The Law of Least Effort`. Ensure that you minimize any
frictions associated with a good habit. Priming your environment (:point_up:) greatly
helps with this. 
An important point here, is that the time spent on a behaviour is not as
important as the number of times you do it.  
Many years ago, a music teacher told me that it was better to practise for 2
minutes every day, than for 2 hours once a week. The daily repitition helps you
to become the person that you want to be (a reader, a musician etc) and your
muscle memory improves quicker than with reduced frequency.

#### Make it satisying.

The fourth law of behaviour change. It's important that your new habit is
rewarding. Our brains have evolved to favour immediate reward over delayed
rewards. This probably goes way back to the hunter-gatherers who never knew
where and when the next meal would come from. 
Maybe if your goal is to become someone who exercises and looks after
themselves, then your short term reward for hitting the gym is to go for a
massage. This aligns the short term reward with the long term motivation. The
author explains that the reward of a bowl of ice-ceam for a successful workout
does not align and leads to conflicting identies.

Whatever the choice, to get a habit to stick, it's important that you feel an
immediate success once you have responded to the cue.

#### Inversions of the above
Worth noting that whilst the four laws of behaviour change can be used to build
better habits, we can use their inversions to break bad habits.

1. Make it invisible (reduce exposure by removing cues).
2. Make it unattractive (highlight the benfits of avoiding the bad habit).
3. Make it difficult (increase friction between you and the habit).
4. Make it unsatisfying (make the costs public and painful).

### Summary

I've just noted down some points and takeaways that I found useful over the
course of this book. This book was recommended to me, rather than me seeking to
change existing habits, but I have found that the book has has a positive effect
on my outlook of day to day activities, my prioritisation of tasks, and how I
choose to spend my time. 

__Tiny Changes Lead To Remarkable Results__.

I'd definitely recommend this one.
