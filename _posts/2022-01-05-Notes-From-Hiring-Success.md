Notes from [Hiring Success : How Visionary CEOs Compete for the Best Talent](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hiring-Success-Visionary-Compete-Talent/dp/1544506899/). 

Stop relying on Time-to-Hire and Cost-per-Hire metrics. They are not indicators of successful hiring.  
We need three metrics to accurately measure our hiring success.

1. Hiring Budget
2. Hiring Velocity
3. Net Hiring Score

## Hiring Budget
_Total Cost of Recruiting / New Hire Payroll_, where cost includes TA salaries, technology spend, candidate travel cost, marketing & advertising.  

Typical spend is between 5% and 15%, but this depends on speed and quality. See below.

## Hiring Velocity
The percentage of jobs filled on time. A velocity of above 80% indicates healthy progress. 

**TTH is meaningless if we are not enabling the company’s objectives.** In other words, does it matter if TTH has been reduced by x% if projects are not being completed due to lack of resources?

## Net Hiring Score
Measures job fit, and should not be derived from your end of year performance reviews. Simple three step formula to calculate NHS.

1. Ask HM: On a scale of 0-10, how much of a fit is the new hire for the job?
2. Ask NH: On a scale of 0-10, how much of a fit is the job for you?
3. _NHS = (% of strong fits - % poor fits) x 100_, where poor fits = {0…6} and strong = {9,10}
