A short post on the merits of doing just one thing at a time, extracted mostly
from Jeff Sutherland's Scrum
[book](https://www.bookdepository.com/Scrum-Jeff-Sutherland/9780385346450), and some supporting / referenced materials.

Multi-tasking is a myth. Humans cannot multi-task. Stop trying to multi-task.

Our brains cannot do two things at the <b>exact</b> same time. We can think
about two things (in different lobes of the brain), but to actually process
those things, our brain switches back and forth serially between each.

The same logic can be applied to working on multiple projects / problems or
discussions / conversations. Juggling introduces an 
overhead referred to as 'Loss to context-switching'.

Loss to context-switching can be thought of as the effort expended to reposition
yourself into the last context of the project / train of thought that you switch to.  

In software development, this might be re-familiarising yourself with the project
domain, the programming language, the story requirements etc. This is wasted
effort.  

There has been much research into waste within the software
industry and we can quantify it. Take a look at the following table which appears in [Quality Software
Management: System Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/Quality-Software-Management-Systems-Thinking/dp/0932633722) by Gerald Weinberg.

| Number of simultaneous projects	| Percent of time available per project	| Loss to context-switching |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1 | 100% | 0% |
| 2	| 40%	 | 20% |
| 3	| 20%  | 40% |
| 4	| 10%  | 60% |
| 5	| 5%	 | 75% |
  
Madness right?  

If you are hopping between five different projects, then
you are only devoting 5% per project, the waste due to context-switching is 75%.
In that scenario, for each hop, you are wasting 20% of effort. 

This doesn't only apply to software projects, but instead, anything that
requires a specific state of mental awareness that when lost, can take minutes,
or hours to reacquire. Timeboxing, or calendar-blocking as it's also know, can
be a neat tool here. Three or four two-hour blocks of 'Do Not Disturb' time to
support your focused work.  

Pick one thing. Do it, and do it well.
