p. One of the wicked things about VIm is that you learn a new trick every day; well, I do anyway.

I program day to day in either PHP or Ruby, and I normally run a quick syntax check when I save a file.
Previously, I would save the file and run the following from the terminal

For PHP

{% highlight bash %}
  $: php -l filename.php
{% endhighlight %}

For Ruby

{% highlight bash %}
  $: ruby -cw filename.rb
{% endhighlight %}

Then I copped that I could run it without leaving VIm by entering the follwowing commands

For PHP

{% highlight bash %}
  :! php -l %
{% endhighlight %}

For Ruby

{% highlight bash %}
  :! ruby -cw %
{% endhighlight %}

So the next nicety was to have VIm run the check automatically when I save either a PHP or Ruby file.

Simple pop the following in your vimrc and away you go.

{% highlight bash %}
au BufWritePost *.php !php -l %
au BufWritePost *.rb !ruby -cw %
{% endhighlight %}

This simple instructs VIM that when saving a file with either extension, run the required command.
Dead handy,.... and you can swap out the extension and command required for your language of choice.
Enjoy,
