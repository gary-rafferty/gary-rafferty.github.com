h1. {{ page.title }}

I recently wrote a Ruby gem called "Perfecta":http://garyrafferty.com/perfecta, that wraps the Perfect Audience reporting API.

We use Perfect Audience for our retargeting campaigns and having the Ruby client makes it easy to integrate the reports and analytics into other systems.

Full documentation is over on "Github":https://github.com/gary-rafferty/perfecta and the "project page":http://garyrafferty.com/perfecta , but here's a quick a quick overview 

{% highlight bash %}

gem install perfecta

# or place this into your Gemfile and bundle install

gem 'perfecta'

{% endhighlight %}

And then interacting with the API is as simple as

{% highlight ruby %}

client = Perfecta::Client.new do |c|
  c.email = 'email@ddress'
  c.password = 'password'
end

p client.campaign_reports(interval: 'yesterday').inspect

{% endhighlight %}
